Model Set-up: Describing steps of model development
**************************************************

1. User sets up environment
	- Chooser selects that a horse is active by using a Chooser.. if Chooser set "yes" horse is active. Else horse is not active.
	- Sliders used to select 1) horse's average speed
				 2) horse's standard deviation of speed
				 3) win-place-show-ratio of horse
				 4) win-place-show-ratio of jockey
	- Input used to select	 1) horse's name
	-			 2) gate position
	- Slider used to select the length of the race (in furlongs)

2. How to ramp up speed
   - Each horse should start in their gate positions and then accelerate at a reasonable pace
   up to their mean speed if possible.
   - If a horse is blocked, it must go the speed that they are blocked or slower
   - If a horse is not blocked, then they can accelerate to their average mean
   - Once a horse is within 2 standard deviations of their speed, their speed will be 
   simulated by a stochastic process that pulls from the distribution with a mean and
   standard deviation

Document any assumptions made in data collection or model building here
***********************************************************************
1. The length of the race definitely changes the speed. Therefore, if a horse
runs a lot of short races, its speed figures may be exaggerated. It is assumed
that horses previous races are similar in length races to the race being simulated.
2. It is assumed that the jockey's skill and horse's skill have similar affects on
decision making
3. It is assumed that weather, track condition (firm, wet, fast), and the track itself
do not actually affect the outcome of the race.
