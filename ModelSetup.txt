Model Set-up: Describing steps of model development
**************************************************

1. User sets up environment
	- User selects the track length and the number of horses and then
	- appropriately enters the parameters for each horse
	- Matthew: Setup user environment and what variables each agent has
	- Matthew: Did some error checking on the user input.
	- Matthew: Created the horses with their proper variables
	- Matthew: Created the track
	- Matthew: Worked on getting the speed to work
	- Matthew: Measured track dimensions to make model realistic. 1 block ~= 0.00672635 miles
	- Matthew: worked on heading
	- MAatthew: Fixed speed so that the track and the time that the agents navigate the track is realistic

2. How to ramp up speed
   - Each horse should start in their gate positions and then accelerate at a reasonable pace
   up to their mean speed if possible. The acceleration will be governed by a normally distributed random variable around a certain mean
   - If a horse is blocked, it must go the speed that they are blocked or slower
   - If a horse is not blocked, then they can accelerate to their average mean
   - Once a horse is within 2 standard deviations of their speed, their speed will be 
   simulated by a stochastic process that pulls from the distribution with a mean and
   standard deviation
   

3. Things that need to be done
	- How to not make them overlap
		- look at "myself" and "self" keys
		- ability to ask neighbors (patches around an agent) and perform an operation
		- look at the ability to see distance betweeen two agents
		- idea: Length and speeds are realistic. We can scale the distances differently. 
	- How to implement decisions
	- Issue: Horse behind will always be disadvantaged...
	- need to implement run-up
	- need to implement distance
	- need to implement statistical collection/result comparison

***********************************************************************
Document any assumptions made in data collection or model building here
***********************************************************************
1. The length of the race definitely changes the speed. Therefore, if a horse
runs a lot of short races, its speed figures may be exaggerated. It is assumed
that horses previous races are similar in length races to the race being simulated.
2. It is assumed that the jockey's skill and horse's skill have similar affects on
decision making
3. It is assumed that weather, track condition (firm, wet, fast), and the track itself
do not actually affect the outcome of the race.
4. Issues: Run-up time. horse's run up to the gate and then start, which skews data and throws
off the simulation. The simulation takes into account the run-up by not starting the race length
for a specific amount, which can be set. Often between 0 and 0.03 miles.
